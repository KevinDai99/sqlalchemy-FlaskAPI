# sqlalchemy

In this project, I explored how to query data via SQL alchemy and set up an API through Flask. This project is devided into two parts as seen below

## Jupyter Notebook & sqlalchemy

* Queried data on Hawaii precipitation and temperature 
* Data explored from the queries 

## Python and Flask
* Developed an API to query data on Hawaii precipitation and temperature
* Developed various parameters to filter queries based on start and end date, list of stations, and others etc. etc.
